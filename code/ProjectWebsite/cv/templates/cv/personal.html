		<div class="Text">I have wanted to work in the field of technology and computer science since starting a GCSE in Computer Science at Bishop Challoner Catholic College. I discovered a hidden talent for coding and software development right at the start of the course, receiving an introduction to coding in python, which I quickly grew to appreciate and study outside of lessons, developing programs and projects for my own enjoyment. From this point onwards, I knew I wanted to work in the field of computer science. I continued with my studies at Bishop Challoner, while also considering where to go to further my understanding; I decided to go with the University of Birmingham’s Computer Science course, specifically a degree apprenticeship with Vodafone UK.<br>

		I have completed the first 2 years of the course, where I have developed my understanding of other programming languages, such as Java, C and Haskell. Furthermore, through the modules, I have furthered my understanding of Artificial Intelligence, Functional programming and the fundamentals of software design. I also have a base understanding of the aspects of business management from my Business Organisation and Management module, alongside an introduction to Financial Analysis – these skills I hope to develop further in my industrial year at Vodafone UK.<br>

		Before my time at the university, I developed my social interaction and team working skills by being part of the Scouting organisation since primary school, graduating through each level of scouting and making my way up to Explorers. Furthermore, I gained a more work-focused approach to teamwork during my team projects at the University, such as Artificial Intelligence, where we developed code that would navigate a small robot around a course, or Software Engineering, where we designed the outline and structure of an application helping mental health for students.<br>

		I’d like to take on more of a software development role in an organisation, instead of small in-house projects or other such items.</div>
